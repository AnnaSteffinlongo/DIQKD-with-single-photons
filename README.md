Examples of scripts data presented in arXiv:2409.17075.

- asymptotic_key.py can be used to produce the asymptotic key rate as a function of the noise. This results in the curves in Fig.5 in Appendix B.
- finite_size_key.py can be used to obtain the finite-size key rate as a function of the number of protocol rounds N.
- finite_size_distance.py can be used to obtain the finite-size key rate as a function of the distance between Alice and Bob for a fixed value of N. This results in Fig.3 in the main text.
